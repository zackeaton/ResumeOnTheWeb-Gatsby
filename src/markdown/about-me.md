Hey there!

My name is Zack, and I am an Information Systems & Technology graduate from the University of Missouri Saint Louis. One thing I particularly enjoyed about majoring in Information Systems is that this field really allows me to use both my technical skills like computer programming and my front facing business skills. I am very is passionate about data and analytics and I enjoy helping companies make better use of current data, as well as collecting new data.

I've participated in a variety of school events. Everything from hackathons, networking events, and even intermural pickleball. I am an active member of The National Society of Leadership and Success, Information Systems Programming Club, CompTIA AITP, and Marketing Club. I volunteered my film and editing skills to produce the original promotional video for the first UMSL Hack, which was a huge success. UMSL Hack just put on its fourth hackathon in February 2020.

You can keep up with me on the social media accounts linked aboved. I am always looking to try new food, beverages, and experiences.
