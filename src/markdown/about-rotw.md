**Resume on the Web** has been a project that I've been focused on since the early 2014s. I didn't want my information to be displayed on just a sheet of paper that only HRs or Talent Scouts had the privilege of reading, I wanted it to be accessible to everyone. And that's how this project was conceptualized.

I constantly update it to match who I am, because just like this website, I don't have a static personality. I use the latest technologies and use this platform to challenge myself into learning new frameworks, new build tools, experiment with new design ideas while keeping the core principle of getting to know me as simple as possible.

This version of the project was built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (React), a little bit of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to query local data, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for their utility-first classes and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to host the site.

I hope you loved the site as much as I enjoyed developing it and learning from it. If you did, please let me know using the [contact form](#contact) above, I would be **ecstatic** to hear from you.

If you would like to peek around the code and see what makes this website tick, the complete source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/ResumeOnTheWeb-Gatsby). You can even edit it to make your own version of the site, as this project is <span title="Yes, that's a real word." class="underline">copylefted</span> under the permissive [MIT License](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/ResumeOnTheWeb-Gatsby/blob/master/LICENSE).
